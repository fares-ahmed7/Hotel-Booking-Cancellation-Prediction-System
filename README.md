# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts whether a hotel booking will be canceled before check-in.

The project covers the complete ML workflow, including data preprocessing, model comparison using cross-validation, model evaluation, deployment with Flask, and containerization using Docker.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

Hotel booking cancellations can significantly impact hotel revenue and operational planning. This project builds several machine learning models to predict booking cancellations and automatically selects the best-performing model based on ROC-AUC cross-validation.

The final solution is deployed as a REST API using Flask and containerized with Docker.
